3. WHEN a device joins an existing match THEN the system SHALL receive the current game state automatically
4. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue functioning locally and resync when connectivity is restored
5. WHEN conflicts occur between device states THEN the system SHALL implement a conflict resolution strategy prioritizing the referee device

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a tournament organizer, I want to track multiple concurrent matches and overall tournament progress, so that I can manage complex tournament brackets efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
